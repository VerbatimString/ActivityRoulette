App showcase:

![](https://github.com/VerbatimString/ActivityRoulette/blob/main/app_showcase.gif)

Originally created in September 2022, in order to get familiar with Kotlin (as I was transitioning from Java).

Also explored the following libraries:

-Kotlin Flow <br />
-Material Motion (shared transitions) <br />
-Dagger/Hilt <br />

The app layout was created using XML and view binding was used to connect UI with code.

Additionally, BoredAPI's REST service was used to fetch and display data. Thanks to the https://www.boredapi.com/ for the data. Retrofit was used in order to make HTTP requests at appropriate endpoints.
